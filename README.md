# Embedded System Learning
In this repo I will document and share all my learning process of Embedded Systems publicly.  Note that I already have some knowledge from university courses and work experience.  My plan is to reinforce my fundamental knowledge going from almost zero all the way to advanced projects that I can share publicly.
